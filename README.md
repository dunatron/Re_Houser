  - `Next.js` for server side rendering, routing and tooling
  - `StyledComponents` for styling
  - `React-Apollo` for interfacing with Apollo Client
  - `Material-UI` for theming and styling _(works well with styled components)_
- Apollo Client => For data management:
  - Perform GraphQL `Mutations`
  - Fetching GraphQL `Queries`
  - `Caching` GraphQL data
  - Managing `Local State`
  - `Error` and `Loading` UI states
  - _Note: Apollo client replaces the need for redux + data fetching/caching libraries_
- GraphQL Yoga => An express GraphQL Server for:
  - Implementing `Query` and `Mutation Resolvers`
  - Custom `Server Side Logic`
  - `Charging` credit cards
  - `Sending Email`

  <summary>Architecture - Back-end</summary>

## Architecture - Back-end

- index.js _(src/index.js)_ - This is the entry point for our application and serves as the following:
  - imports our `createServer.js` file and starts it
  - implements cors when starting server so that only our site and credentials can hit it
  - something else
- db.js _(src/db.js)_ - This file connects to the remote prisma DB and gives us the ability to query it with JS
- createServer.js _(src/createServer.js)_ - Creates our GraphQL Yoga server

  - Is an express server so can use other express middlewre
  - sits on top of apollo server
  - imports our resolvers _(Queries and Mutations)_ and sets them up with our server
  - _note: you would need to import everything graphql yoga does to get a working grahql server_

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Architecture - Front-end</summary>

## Architecture - front-end

- \_app.js _(pages/\_app.js)_ - is the base document and essentially the entry point for our app:
  - It extends `next/App` and is rendered on ever page as the highest order component
  - It has a prop called `Component` which will render the current page we are on as its component. _(the name of the route is the page that will be rendered from the pages folder)_
  - This Component prop is wrapped in a `Page` component from the `components` folder and is where most of our theming wil take place
- \_document.js _(pages/\_document.js)_ - is our hook into `next/document`:
  - Is rendered on the server side
  - Is used to change the initial server side rendered document markup
  - Commonly used to implement server side rendering for css-in-js libraries
  - uses the ServerStyleSheet from styled components along with `next/document` to crawl our component and get any styles it needs for the page
  - _note: there is also an NoSsr tag found in the Page component to render the material theme server side_
- Page.js _(components/Page.js)_ - Is where we can do our theming and wraps every page:
  - entry point for theming such as `StyledComponents` and `Material-UI` setup
  - contains the Header.js component as we want to include it on every page
  - contains our `Meta.js` component to include all of the classic meta tags
  - uses the children prop to inherit and render the current page we are on.
- Header.js _(components/Header.js)_ - Our standard Header to be included on every page:
  - contains our `Nav.js` component
  - contains our search bar _(ToDo: update when we have entry component)_
  - contains our cart _(ToDo: update when we have entry component)_
  - contains nProgress UI and has the Router to render loading ui to the user
- Meta.js _(component/Meta.js)_ - Takes care of all the meta tags you would normally see in an html document:
  - contains `next/head` to update our document header and do side effects behind the scenes
  - title tag
  - any external css you may need to include
  - fb, twitter etc meta tags
  - loads in our `nProgress` css from the static folder
  - contains our viewport meta for responsive design
  - uses utf-8 for character encoding
  - loads in our favicon

  <summary>Scripts</summary>

## Backend scripts

- e.g inside the backend directory run `yarn run deploy`

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "nodemon -e js,graphql -x node src/index.js",
  "dev": "nodemon -e js,graphql -x node --inspect src/index.js",
  "test": "jest",
  "deploy": "prisma deploy --env-file variables.env"
}
```

## Frontend scripts

- e.g inside the frontend directory run `yarn run dev`

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next -p 7777",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start",
  "test": "NODE_ENV=test jest --watch",
  "heroku-postbuild": "next build"
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Prisma Setup</summary>

## Next.js environment setup

###### next.config.js

- find the env object key and place keys in here
- They will be fed in by .env when build by next

```.env
STRIPE_KEY="pk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
GOOGLE_API_KEY="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXvk0"
```

## Prisma Setup.

- with the boiler plate navigate to the backend and install prisma globally `npm i -g prisma`
- Then run `prisma login` which will open up your browser _(You will want a prisma.io account)_
- Then run `prisma init` which will run you through a setup process on where you want to deploy your prisma server and will create 2 files for you:
  - `prisma.yml` - contains our server endpoint for setup, you will want to modify this file and create a `variables.env` file
  - `datamodel.graphql` -

###### prisma.yml

```yml
endpoint: ${env:PRISMA_ENDPOINT}
datamodel: datamodel.graphql
# secret is the database password, ommiting it in dev means easier development
# secret: ${env:PRISMA_SECRET}
hooks:
  post-deploy:
    - graphql get-schema -p prisma
```

###### variables.env

```.env

  <summary>Alpha Deployment</summary>
Not the easiest thing in the world to deploy or manage since we have 3 parts
- Prisma Server
  - holds our Mysql database and where we deploy our schema to
- Yoga Server
  - Mutation and Query resolvers
- React/Next App
  - Our react application which is actually a node server which runs next.js and makes sure we can do our server side rendering

1. Prisma (Part 1)
   - Sign into the prisma webapp [Prisma Web App](https://www.prisma.io/)
   - The servers that prisma gives you are just development servers, you cant use them in production, you need to host your own. However you can use the prisma dashboard to manage the data and interface with prisma
   - click `Add server`
     - we will host on there server atm which only currently support PostgreSQL
     - create the prisma Database which may take a few seconds.
       - if you get a graphql error you may need to unlink heroku account [see issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-cloud-feedback/issues/191)
     - once the database is created we can then create the server which we will also host on heroku
     - setup server g the free account
     - create prisma server wich may take a few minutes
     - we have then created our server (rehouser-prisma) now we need to create the service for prisma
2. Prisma (Part 2)
   - use the prisma cli and run `prisma deploy` and choose our server we created earlier/above to connect to
3. Yoga

   - You need to install heroku for your machine https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
   - restart your terminal
   - we are running a single git repo with two application in it instead of running two seperate repos for the front and back end
   - commit your code to your repo.
   - you will need to run the `heroku login` command which will bring up a web interface to login to
   - run `heroku apps:create rehouser-yoga-prod` which will create the application on heroku for us.
     - It will also create a git remote for us to use
     - https://git.heroku.com/rehouser-yoga-prod.git
     - and the application endpoint
     - https://rehouser-yoga-prod.herokuapp.com/
   - NOTE: the above remotes are essentially useless. if you were to deploy it, heroku wouldnt know what to run as we have two apps in `server` and the `client` folder. WE need to create sub remotes to deploy
   - Take the remote we just created and create a new remote like so
   - `git remote add heroku-server https://git.heroku.com/rehouser-yoga-prod.git`
   - `git subtree push --prefix server heroku-server master`
   - You will then need to go into the heroku dashboard and find the app and in its settings upload the .env variables

4. Next.js
   - inside of the client folder open up config.js and make sure the endpoints are pointing to the live yoga apps we just created
   - make sure you are in the root
   - run `heroku apps:create rehouser-next-prod` which will create the next.js application on heroku for us
   - It will also create a url and git remote for us
   - https://rehouser-next-prod.herokuapp.com/
   - https://git.heroku.com/rehouser-next-prod.git
   - Take the remote we just created and create a new remote like so
   - `git remote add heroku-client https://git.heroku.com/rehouser-next-prod.git`
   - `git subtree push --prefix client heroku-client master`
   - Now when we deply next.js to heroku we need to deploy the `client/.next` folder but since we do not include it in git because it is a compiled build we need to build it before we deploy.
   - ensure this is in the package.json scripts `"heroku-postbuild": "next build"`
   - again go to heroku and add env variables for next js

CORS

- We may want to pass in an array of allowed urls for the server or some sort of star for heroku and rehouser?
  NOTE REMOVE CORS
- Go to index on server an comment out this object

```
 {
  cors: {
    credentials: true,
    origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL,
  },
},
```

- on the client side comment out this in withData.js

```
 fetchOptions: {
      credentials: 'include',
    },
```

99. Steps to redeploy

- `git subtree push --prefix server heroku-server master`
- `git subtree push --prefix client heroku-client master`

- client docs
  - run `heroku apps:create client-docs` which will generate a new git remote
  - https://client-docs.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/client-docs.git
  - git remote add heroku-client-docs https://git.heroku.com/client-docs.git
  - git subtree push --prefix client/.docz/dist heroku-client-docs master

  - No default language could be detected for this app.
  - HINT: This occurs when Heroku cannot detect the buildpack to use for this application automatically.
  - See https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks

<details>
  <summary>Deployment</summary>
## Deployment

1. Prisma DB
   1. inside the `backend` directory run `yarn run deploy-prod`
2. Yoga Service
   - Heroku
     - run `heroku apps:create trader-yoga-prod` which will create a git url and create a new remote
     - Our app is however is structered into two folders at the root git level "backend" and "frontend" so we need to add a remote
     - run `git remote add heroku-backend https://git.heroku.com/trader-yoga-prod.git`
     - push subtree `git subtree push --prefix backend heroku-backend master`
3. React/Next
   - Heroku
     - run `heroku apps:create trader-next-prod` which will create a git url and create a new remote
     - run `git remote add heroku-frontend https://git.heroku.com/trader-next-prod.git`
     - You would then need to build the assets `yarn run build` but because we dont commit our next build we are in a funny situation
     - SOLUTION add to package.json scripts `"heroku-postbuild": "next build"`
     - You also need to modify the `start` command in package.json scripts `"start": "next start -p $PORT"`
     - run `git subtree push --prefix frontend heroku-frontend master`

#### server

- when setting up a new cluster you need to manually run `prisma deploy` from the backend and setup the new service
- `git subtree push --prefix server heroku-backend master`
- `git subtree push --prefix server prod-backend master`

#### client

- `git subtree push --prefix client heroku-frontend master`
- `git subtree push --prefix client prod-frontend master`

#### NEW HEROKU DEPLOYMENT

Notes:

- heroku has tight integration with Prisma and both are just fantastic
- Prisma has a nice gui to interface with your databases data

Step 1: Deploy Prisma

- using the GUI in prisma create a new server and fill in details:
  - serverName: rehouser-production
  - serverDescription: prod of rehouser
  - create a new db on heroku
  - create new server n heroku
  - Now we need to deploy. We have environment variables so...
    - We run this regular deploy command + a few flags
    - `prisma deploy --env-file variables.env -n`
      - Deploy to the existing server you created on prisma as the option
        - name: rehouser-prod
        - stage: prod
      - And the deployment of prisma shall be done
      - This will alter your pisma.yml file
        - Move these variables to a prod-variables.env file or something like that
        - Note dont forget the ws
          - http:
          - ws:

Step 2: Deploy Yoga/Business logic server(To heroku)

- Yoo need heroku
  - globally `brew install heroku/brew/heroku`
    - Note: this if for mac and versions may also differ. Brew is great. get brew
  - Now you want to be at the root of the app. i.e its folers would be
    - server
    - client
  - run `heroku apps:create rehouser-yoga-prod`
  - You will then get a new git remote e.g
    - https://git.heroku.com/rehouser-yoga-prod.git
  - run `git remote add heroku-backend {GIt repo for new heroku}`
    - git remote add prod-backend https://git.heroku.com/rehouser-yoga-prod.git
- run `git subtree push --prefix server prod-backend master`
  - Now let that deploy and it should be fine
  - ....

Step 3: Deploy front end/client

- heroku apps:create rehouser-next-prod
  - Yu will then get agit reote `https://git.heroku.com/rehouser-next-prod.git`
  - git remote add prod-frontend https://git.heroku.com/rehouser-next-prod.git

Step 4: add a real domain

- git subtree push --prefix server heroku-backend master

#### get myPropertyLeases

on the serverSide I have set it up So you can simply call this query and you would  
recieve everything available to you.  
The server will only return things you are apart of and has the following injected into the where before it hits the database

```js
query myLeases($where:PropertyLeaseWhereInput) {
  myLeases(where:$where) {
    id
  }
}
// there where (the below is always injected by the server)
{
  "where": {
    "id":"",
    "OR": [
      {
        "owners_some":{
          "id":""
        }
      },
      {
        "tenants_some":{
          "id":""
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
const where = {
      ...args.where,
      OR: [
        {
          owners_some: {
            id: ctx.request.userId,
          },
        },
        {

- Headline
  - Tips for a great headline
    - What‚Äôs the main attraction?
      - Think of one key feature that tenants are going to love about your property. Open plan? Large backyard? Close to transport? Renovated?
    - Under 6 words
      - A catchy and memorable phrase that captures their attention. e.g. "Wubbalubbadubdub", "And that's the wayyyyyy the news goes!"
        - AIDS!
        - And that's why I always say, 'Shumshumschilpiddydah!
        - GRASSSSS... tastes bad
    - Don't repeat what they already know
      - They can already see the suburb, number of bedrooms and type of property so don't say ‚Äò4 bedroom house'.
    - Headline Examples
      - North-facing and newly renovated
      - Transport and amenities at your door
      - Extra spacious open plan living
    - Bullet points vs Paragraph of text
      - Both work great together. Paragraphs help set the scene and build emotion. While bullet points are a great way to list specific features your potential tenants can check off.
      - 100 words is enough
        - Not a hard fast rule. You want to provide just enough information to make it worth an inspection.
      - Call to action
        - Give them a reason to take action. Here's an example: This house has always leased in a few days so get in quick before it's gone.
- Description
- Photos
- Floorplans
- Protection - helps you get setup with the right insurances and compliance. Select the protection you are interested in finding out more about.
  - Landlord Insurance
  - Building Insurance
  - Smoke alarm compliance
    - {COMPANY_NAME} can help owners get and keep smoke alarm compliant without lifting a finger that may save your tenants life.
  - Keep your home pest free
    - The easiest way to avoid dealing with pest issues is to be proactive. Get a pre tenant inspection done and you will find the majority of pest issues become a tenant responsibility. (except possums, termites, bees etc). You will be advised if any treatment is required.
  - Home Emergency Policy
    - Get covered for a range of Home Emergency call outs 24-7, 365 days/year. It's like roadside assistance, except for your home. Plans to suit different budgets offering between 2-8 call-outs per year, up to \$300 toward each call-out.

MONEY STUFF

- Weekly Rent amount (300)
  - LOL at cubi calulations/math
  - 300 \* 52 = 15600
  - 1200 \* 12
  - Pr5obs more going on here than my initial lol
  - obviously reserach this heavily
- Frequency of rent payments
  - weekly (\$300.00)
  - fortnighlty (\$600.00)
  - Four weekly (\$1200.00)
  - Monthly (\$1303.57)

Frequency of rent payments HELP

- What does this mean?
  - How often rent is paid. Your property will be advertised at the weekly rent regardless of which option you choose.
- What is normal?
  - Fortnightly. This is also the maximum allowed in NSW.
- Can this be changed?
  - Yes, anytime. You can change this when you secure your new tenant.
- What is a bond?
  - Money paid by the tenant before they move in and held by the bond authority. After the tenant moves out you can claim money from the bond if money is owing (for cleaning, rent, or damages etc).
- How much can I charge?
  - The standard is 4 weeks' rent in NSW. This is also the maximum amount you can charge regardless of the situation (pets, furnished or you increase the rent).
- Can I change this later?
  - Yes. In fact we recommend leaving the bond amount as per default for now. The bond can be changed anytime up until the lease is signed.
- What's my place worth?
  - Renters determine value by comparing each property on the market for rent. So you should do the same. If you have a few weeks before the property is vacant you might set the rent the same or a little higher (and vice versa).
- Can I change it later?
  - Yes, you can change the rent amount at anytime while advertising. You can also accept any price (higher or lower) than your listed price.
- What if I price it too low?
  - You will probably get offers to pay a higher rent. If you have more than 3 quality potential tenants wanting to rent your property (without higher offers) at once you could ask if they would like to offer more.
- What if I price it too high?
  - You should still get some enquiries but from people who are desperate. You're much better off waiting a week for a quality tenant.
- IMPORTANT: what date is your property available for someone to move in
  - My tenants are still in the property
    - We recommend leaving at least 2 days between the move out date and available date so the condition report and any left over cleaning or repairs can be done.
  - What if I don't know yet?
    - Be conservative and give yourself a buffer. In the description you could mention a ‚ÄòPotentially earlier move in date' but set realistic expectations here.
  - What if the date is in the past?
    - pfft give me some respect... It will show as ‚ÄòAvailable Now'.
  - How long would you like the initial lease to be?
    - default 12 months(recommended)
    - What does this mean?
      - Think of it like a contract period. You can keep renewing the lease (contract period) as many times as you like. Don't mistake this with how long you want the tenants to be in your property.
    - Can I change this?
      - Yes, anytime, except after you've signed the lease! You can change this when you secure your new tenant.
    - What's normal?
      - 12 months but don't let that stop you. If you're after long term tenants feel free to put down 24 months (or even longer). There is no minimum. The maximum is 5 years. Some areas allow longer leases so talk to us for specific advice on this.
    - Where is this displayed?
      - TRON QUESTION: why is this the case? seems annoying and like a click bait to me. remove it shouldnt be part of our reasoning or thinking. i.e show it always
      - Only when the tenant requests to rent your property. It is not listed on your advertisement.
    - What happens when the lease is over?
      - It automatically rolls over to a month to month lease until one of you give notice. We'll ask if you want to renew the lease well and truly before this anyway.

  <summary>Heroku Deployments</summary>
  Visit this url to get an understanding of Heroku and how it works [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)

## setup

### Step 1 - install

- MAC - `brew install heroku/brew/heroku`
- Ubuntu - `sudo snap install heroku --classic`

### Step 2 - login

- `heroku login`
  This command opens your web browser to the Heroku login page. If your browser is already logged in to Heroku, simply click the Log in button displayed on the page. This authentication is required for both the heroku and git commands to work correctly.

### Step 3 - create app

- `heroku create {app-name}`

### Step 4 - deploy app

- `git push heroku master`
- The application is now deployed. Ensure that at least one instance of the app is running:
- `heroku ps:scale web=1`
- Now visit the app at the URL generated by its app name. As a handy shortcut, you can open the website as follows:
- `heroku open`

### Step 5 - view logs

- `heroku logs --tail`
- Visit your application in the browser again, and you‚Äôll see another log message generated.
- Press Control+C to stop streaming the logs.

### Step 6 - defina a Procfile

- This is important. Defining these is how you start your app and run taks like cron jobs etc
- https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile
- `web: node index.js`

### Step 7 - scale dynos

- https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#scale-the-app
- `heroku ps:scale web=0` to have xero dynos which will mean our app can no longer serve or handle requests
- `heroku ps:scale web=1`

### Step 8 - app dependencies

Heroku recognizes an app as Node.js by the existence of a package.json file in the root directory. For your own apps, you can create one by running npm init --yes.

- https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#declare-app-dependencies

### Step 9 - run app locally

Now start your application locally using the heroku local command, which was installed as part of the Heroku CLI:

- `heroku local web`  
  Just like Heroku, heroku local examines the Procfile to determine what to run.
  Open http://localhost:5000 with your web browser. You should see your app running locally.

### Step 10 - push local changes

- make some changes to the application
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "Add cool face API"`
- `git push heroku master`
- `heroku open cool`

### Step 11 - Provision add-ons

Add-ons are third-party cloud services that provide out-of-the-box additional services for your application, from persistence through logging to monitoring and more.

- `heroku addons:create papertrail`
- list add on for app `heroku addons`
- open papertrail add on `heroku addons:open papertrail`

### Step 12 - start a console

- `heroku run bash`

### Step 3 - env management

- heroku local will automatically set up the environment based on the contents of the .env file in your local directory. In the top-level directory of your project, there is already a .env file that has the following contents:
- To set the config var on Heroku, execute the following: `heroku config:set TIMES=2`
- View the config vars that are set using heroku config: `heroku config`
