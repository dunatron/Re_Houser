          Save it for the Semantics Dome, E.B. White. Snuffles want to be
          understood. Snuffles need to be understood. I wish that shotgun was my
          penis. Awwww thanks, bitch!

          Oh, wow. That's an intense line of questioning, Snuffles It takes,
          like, 78 years to hang a dragon to death. First off, I always slay it,
          queen. Secondly, yes. Where do you want to die?

          aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a
          grape? You know who's into dragons, Morty? Nerds who refuse to admit
          they're Christian. Okay, take it easy Rick. T-that's dark. I do not
          have discolored butthole flaps.
