            Instead of subscribing to a technology provider (as most Property
            Management agencies do) and offsetting the cost onto landlords,
            weâ€™ve developed our own software and offer direct access to all of
            our customers.
          </Typography>,
          <Typography gutterBottom>
            We offer the full services of a Property Management agency, while
            giving full transparency into the process through your online
            Rehouser account.
          </Typography>,
          <Typography gutterBottom>
            Rehouser management is one part Property Investor and one part
            Coder, both with the drive to collaborate to offer better value for
            local landlords.

            portfolio.
