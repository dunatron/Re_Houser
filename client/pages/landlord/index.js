            previous landlords contact details, references, credit check, photo
            identification and Tenancy Tribunal check. A face to face meeting
            will then need to be booked with a Rehouser Property Manager for
            final vetting. All information will be stored on the platform where
            it will be readily available to the Property Owner.
