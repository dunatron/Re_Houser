      I will handle Associated Appraisla for a property. More than likely I will
      be an accordion dropdown that will display the information that is being
      loaded information Who it was appraised by? there details. Also WHen it
      has been used it should trigger saying so. Can probably remove . Maybe can
      even take in the loadQuery stuff that allows us to handle that logic, and
      call a function to pass the databack once loaded loadedData for instance
      as a data callback
    </div>

export default AssociatedAppraisal;
