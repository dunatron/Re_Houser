  #   Think about how we are going to design this form
  # perhaps a json object could be useful for this
  # ideally the form itself is created from the property and the features and rooms it has on the property.
  # so we almost have a key/val structure. or rather an array of items that are objects. These objects will have things like.
  # status(poor, average, very good) and comments and a key for the name? and perhaps a type
  # json structure and jsonVals ?

  vals: Json
  status: InspectionFieldStatus # anoying, but if not actually in schema its values are missing
